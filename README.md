This program implements a new and efficient container identical to **std::vector < T >** in terms of behavior,
but more economical at runtime. The data structure behaves like a vector, but implements an efficient memory management method
that takes advantage of the advantages of the stack and the heap and minimizes their disadvantages.

More Documentation will be written soon
